Overview
The Task Management App is a simple task management solution built using SwiftUI and Core Data. It allows users to create, view, update, delete, and organize tasks with associated properties such as title, description, priority, status, and due date. The app features customizable settings and integrates Core Data for persistent storage.

Features
Task Details View: Displays task information including title, description, priority, status, and due date. Allows users to update the task's status (e.g., from pending to completed).

Task Home View: Displays a list of tasks with the ability to filter and sort tasks. Users can view task progress via a circular progress indicator, and manage tasks through gestures (delete, move, etc.).

Settings View: Allows users to customize the app's appearance, such as selecting an accent color.

Core Data Integration: Core Data is used to manage task data persistently. Tasks are retrieved from and saved to a local database.
